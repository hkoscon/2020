WebAssembly is also much closer to the underlying hardware, and hence much more performant than Java and JavaScript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared with low level virtualization containers like Docker, WebAssembly is lighter, safer, and easier to manage. WebAssembly is supported on almost any computer operating system today. WebAssembly bytecode applications can just run anywhere. There is no need to package an operating system inside your virtual machine like Docker does.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a bytecode virtual machine, WebAssembly has a well-designed security model for accessing hardware.
