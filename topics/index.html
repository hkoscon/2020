WebAssembly is supported on almost any computer operating system today. WebAssembly bytecode applications can just run anywhere. There is no need to package an operating system inside your virtual machine like Docker does.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a bytecode virtual machine, WebAssembly has a well-designed security model for accessing hardware. It is a lot harder to crash or do dangerous things in WebAssembly than in a native environment like Docker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this talk, we will review recent open source innovations that bring WebAssembly-based services to the market. We will provide a live demo on how to create and deploy a Rust application and deploy it on WebAssembly as a microservice. Topics we will cover include the following.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduction to Rust and WebAssembly</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The case for WebAssembly on the server</li>\r\n\t<li>WebAssembly implementations that are optimized for the server side</li>\r\n\t<li>Dependency Injection container for WebAssembly</li>\r\n\t<li>RPC services for WebAssembly</li>\r\n\t<li>A complete stateless microservice example in Rust</li>\r\n\t<li>A complete stateful microservice example in Rust</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Audience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Software developers, CIOs, CTOs, IT managers</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audience will learn basic concepts of Rust and WebAssembly. At the end of the session, they will be able to write and deploy a Rust-based web service in the cloud on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Familiarity with cloud computing, familiarity with web services, working knowledge of at least one commonly used programming language.</p>\r\n",venue:{name:p,weight:1},language:t,language_sym_interp:[],level:d,speakers:[{name:"Michael Yuan",community:"Second State Inc",country:"United States",description:"<p>Dr. Michael Yuan is the CEO of the Second State Inc, and a co-founder of the CyberMiles Foundation.
